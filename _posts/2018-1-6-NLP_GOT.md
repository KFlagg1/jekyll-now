title: NLP - Game of Thrones
---

This is a practice Natural Language Processing project that I adapted from a [web video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY9EwZ02sXU). My first attempt was to gain an intro and practice with the NLP libraries.  I've created several exploratory notebooks to work with visualization and word embeddings.  Beyond exploration, my goal is to gain experience in ways that I may use NLP for feature creation and engineering to improve classification and predictive modeling.

This initial visualizations include 2 dimensional graphing of word relationships (vectors), for each word in the first 5 GOT novels.

A closer look at a section:

Another way to look at relations ships between words is to use cosine similarity to look at related pairs:  This is similar to anologies used in some forms of standardized testing, with these relationships 'learned' by the machine.
