title: Classification Power of Complaint
---

This initial entry is to provide a preliminary overview of the a project that I had worked on which applied Data Science classification models.  For the project I used a data set of 311 Request logs found on  New York City's [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) platform.

311 is the city's non emergency services request line. It allows individuals to report disturbances in their environmental and living conditions, examples include: lack of heating, garbage in vacant lots, noise complaints, elevator outages repairs
