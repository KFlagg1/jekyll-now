title: Error Pricing Monitor
---

As I look to building practical tools using python and data science techniques, I came across this project.  I've begun to build a model that monitors pricing, and identifies tickets with prices below the current low price range through a clustering algorithm.![NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

Next steps are to develop a complete active script that monitors hourly changes, and sends alerts to my email.
